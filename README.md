</p>

The demo allows you to change any of the three key parameters of the Vicsek model on the fly. These are:

  * rho: The density of agents in the system
  * eta: The amount of noise in the system
  * nu: The velocity of the agents
 
If you have problems closing the application, click the 'Freeze' button beforehand.

For more details on the Vicsek model and its implementation, please refer to the lecture notes.
