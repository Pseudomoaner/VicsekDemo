Matlab-based demonstration of the Vicsek model

To run the application, click 'VicsekDemo.mlapp. You should see the following screen appear:

The demo allows you to change any of the three key parameters of the Vicsek model on the fly. These are:

  * rho: The density of agents in the system
  * eta: The amount of noise in the system
  * nu: The velocity of the agents
 
For more details on the Vicsek model and its implementation, see the 'Notes.pdf' document.
